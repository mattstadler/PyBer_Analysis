# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
-The purpose of this analysis is to compare urban, suburban and rural ride metrics. Specifically, ride costs and volumes were examined in detail.

## Results
-Urban areas had the most rides and drivers, followed by suburban then rural areas. Total fares followed the same pattern. However, on a per ride basis, rural rides had the highest fares and also highest average fares per driver. Suburban rides followed, then urban rides.

-Total fares remained relatively flat within each location type between January and April. There appeared to be a slight dip in early January and an uptick in early March.

## Recommendations
1) Increase driver presence in rural areas - the driver to total rides ratio is lowest there
2) Increase drivers in early March to accomodate the increased ride demand.
3) Charge more for urban rides - average fare per ride are lowest there
